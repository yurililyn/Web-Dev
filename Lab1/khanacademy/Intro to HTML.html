        <h1>All about rabbits!</h1>
        
        <h2>Basic info</h2>
        <p>
            Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. 
            They eat the most orange vegetables in our world, and they reproduce more than any human ever has.

        <hr> <h2>"I remember a wondrous moment"</h2>
        <p>
            I can recall that <em>magic moment</em><br>
            When you first came into my sight<br>
            Like fleeting vision, like an omen<br>
            Of <strong>pure beauty and delight</strong>.<br>
            <br>
            So often in my <em>dark surrender</em>,<br>
            In stressful days of mundane race<br>
            I heard your voice so <em>sweet and tender</em><br>
            And dreamed of your delightful grace.<br>
            <br>
            As years passed and <strong>storms got stronger</strong><br>
            I lost my dreams to mundane race<br>
            I could recall your voice no longer<br>
            I could not see your lovely face.<br>
            <br>
            Inprisoned in my desperation<br>
            Dragged into misery and strife,<br>
            Without <strong>God</strong> and inspiration<br>
            Without tears, love and life.<br>
            <br>
            And then one day my <strong>soul awoken</strong><br>
            And you came back into my sight<br>
            Like fleeting vision, like an omen<br>
            Of <strong>pure beauty and delight</strong>.<br>
            <br>
            My heart beats fast in admiration<br>
            And resurrected spirit of<br>
            Divinity, and inspiration<br>
            And ever <strong>tears, life and love</strong>.

            <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at <strong>0</strong>. 
            Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra</em>.

            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first.

            There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.
        </p>
        
        <p>Thankfully, we are <strong>born to learn</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>
            Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall</em>.<br>
            <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
            Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.

            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <em>stronger</em>.

            It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe
            are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere</em> can understand.
