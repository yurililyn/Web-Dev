        <p>The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot').
            <br>In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo,
            <br>eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.</p>

        <p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head.
            <br>Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.</p>

        <p>Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
            <br>Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.</p>
        
        
        <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>
        
        <p>A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion.
    <br>Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16 mph),
    <br>but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi).
    <br>This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water,
    <br>rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion,
    <br>using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward.
    <br>Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator.
    <br>If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.</p>

        <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
        
        <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud,
            <br>and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores.
            <br>The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses,
            <br>whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi.
            <br>Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.</p>

        <p>Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass.
            <br>Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite.
            <br>The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back.
            <br>This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>
